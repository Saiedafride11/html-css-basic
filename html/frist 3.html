<p title="my 'country' name is bangladesh">Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting</strong> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only <mark><em>five centuries, but also the leap</em></mark>into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <u>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release</u> of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
