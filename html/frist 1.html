					<p title="this is 'bangladesh' country">Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text of the printing</strong> and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard <em>dummy text ever since the 1500s,</em> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <u>essentially unchanged. It was popularised</u> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
